# The Tic-Tac-Toe Multiverse [*TicTacToe-Verse*]

## üåå Project Overview

Welcome to the **TicTacToe-Verse**! This repository is a unique collection of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, implemented in an ever-expanding array of programming languages. It serves as a fun and educational exploration of different language paradigms, syntax, and runtime environments, all through the lens of a simple, familiar game.

The goal is to showcase how a single problem can be solved across a wide spectrum of languages, from _high-level_, _object-oriented_, and _functional languages_ to _system-level_ and even _esoteric_ ones.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Diverse Implementations:** Tic-Tac-Toe written in numerous programming languages.
- **Console-Based:** All implementations are command-line applications (except for the HTML/CSS/JS version, which is web-based hosted live at [tttv.76448.org](https://tttv.76448.in)).
- **Basic Game Logic:** Each version includes core game mechanics: _board initialization_, _display_, _player turns_, _input handling_, _move validation_, and _checks for win and draw conditions_.
- **Educational Resource:** Great for comparing _language syntax_, _typical coding patterns_, and _setup processes across different ecosystems_.

## üöÄ Languages Included

This ~~multiverse~~ repository currently spans the following languages (and more to come!):

- **Assembly (x86-64 Linux)** (`TicTacToe.asm`)
- **Bash/Shell Script** (`TicTacToe.sh`)
- **Brainfuck** (`TicTacToe.bf`) - _Minimal static board display due to language limitations._
- **C** (`TicTacToe.c`)
- **C#** (`TicTacToe.cs`)
- **C++** (`TicTacToe.cpp`)
- **Dart** (`TicTacToe.dart`)
- **Elixir** (`TicTacToe.ex`)
- **Erlang** (`TicTacToe.erl`)
- **Fortran** (`TicTacToe.f90`)
- **Go** (`TicTacToe.go`)
- **Groovy** (`TicTacToe.groovy`)
- **Haskell** (`TicTacToe.hs`)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (`TicTacToe.html`) - _Web-based interactive version._
- **INTERCAL** (`TicTacToe.intercal`) - _Minimal static output due to extreme language difficulty._
- **Java** (`TicTacToe.java`)
- **Kotlin** (`TicTacToe.kt`)
- **Lisp (Common Lisp)** (`TicTacToe.lisp`)
- **LOLCODE** (`TicTacToe.lol`) - _Simplified win/draw checks due to language verbosity._
- **Lua** (`TicTacToe.lua`)
- **Nim** (`TicTacToe.nim`)
- **PHP** (`TicTacToe.php`)
- **Prolog** (`TicTacToe.pl`)
- **Python** (`TicTacToe.py`)
- **R** (`TicTacToe.r`)
- **Ruby** (`TicTacToe.rb`)
- **Rust** (`TicTacToe.rs`)
- **Whitespace** (`TicTacToe.ws`) - _Minimal static output due to language invisibility._


## üì¶ How to Run

To run any of the games:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/srijan-76448/tictactoe-verse.git](https://github.com/srijan-76448/tictactoe-verse.git)
    cd tictactoe-verse
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the desired language's file.**
3.  **Install the necessary runtime or compiler for that language** (if you don't have it already).
    - For most languages, specific installation instructions are widely available online.
    - For esoteric languages, you might need to find and install a suitable interpreter.
4.  **Follow the specific compilation/execution instructions** usually provided as comments within each game's source file.

    _Example (for `TicTacToe.py`):_

    ```bash
    python TicTacToe.py
    ```

    _Example (for `TicTacToe.c`):_

    ```bash
    gcc TicTacToe.c -o TicTacToe_c_game
    ./TicTacToe_c_game
    ```

## ü§ù Contributing to the Multiverse

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewLanguageTicTacToe`).
3.  Implement Tic-Tac-Toe in your chosen language (keep it simple and console-based where possible).
4.  Add a brief comment block at the top of your file explaining how to compile/run it.
5.  Add your language to the `LANGUAGES INCLUDED` list in this `README.md`.
6.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add Tic-Tac-Toe in [New Language]'`).
7.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/NewLanguageTicTacToe`).
